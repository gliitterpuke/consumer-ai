# 5-Hour AI Communities Hackathon Sprint Plan

## What We're Building
AI community chat with realistic human-like response behaviors - some agents respond instantly, others take time, some don't respond at all based on hard-coded probabilities, not LLM decisions.

## Core MVP (5 hours)

### Hour 1: LLM Infrastructure Setup (90 min)
**Goal**: Replace template responses with actual OpenAI API calls

#### Tasks:
1. **Create LLM module structure** (15 min)
   ```
   backend/llm/
   ├── openai.js       # OpenAI API wrapper
   ├── prompt.js       # Prompt engineering utilities  
   └── index.js        # Main LLM interface
   ```

2. **Implement OpenAI provider** (45 min)
   - Simple API wrapper with error handling
   - Environment variable for API key
   - Basic prompt + completion pattern
   - Rate limiting and retry logic

3. **Create prompt engineering system** (30 min)
   - System prompt templates with personality injection
   - Message history formatting for context
   - Response length and tone controls

#### Deliverable: 
Working OpenAI integration that can generate responses for any agent

---

### Hour 2: Template → LLM Migration (60 min)
**Goal**: Replace all hardcoded template responses with LLM calls

#### Tasks:
1. **Modify server.js response generation** (30 min)
   - Replace `selectRandomResponse()` with `generateLLMResponse()`
   - Pass agent personality and recent messages as context
   - Maintain existing message queue timing

2. **Agent personality prompting** (20 min)
   - Convert existing agent configs to system prompts
   - Include personality traits, backstory, and response style
   - Add context about current community and conversation

3. **Error handling and fallbacks** (10 min)
   - Fallback to template responses if LLM fails
   - Logging for debugging LLM issues
   - Basic response validation

#### Deliverable:
All 6 dating advice agents responding with actual LLM-generated content

---

### Hour 3: Behavioral Response System (60 min)
**Goal**: Implement realistic response probability and timing behaviors

#### Tasks:
1. **Response probability gates** (25 min)
   ```javascript
   // Add to each agent config
   behavior_config: {
     response_probability: 0.75,  // 75% chance to respond
     min_delay_ms: 1000,         // 1-8 second response time
     max_delay_ms: 8000,
     chattiness_level: 7         // How often they jump in
   }
   ```

2. **Enhance MessageQueue class** (25 min)
   - Check probability before queuing response
   - Calculate dynamic delays based on agent personality
   - Add "typing indicator" simulation timing

3. **Social dynamics logic** (10 min)
   - Don't let same agent respond twice in a row
   - Reduce probability if agent responded recently
   - Increase response chance for direct mentions

#### Deliverable:
Natural conversation flow with varied response patterns per agent

---

### Hour 4: Agent Configuration & Memory (60 min)
**Goal**: JSON-based agent configs and better memory context for LLM

#### Tasks:
1. **Create agent configuration schema** (20 min)
   ```json
   {
     "name": "confidence_coach",
     "llm_config": {
       "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
       "temperature": 0.8,

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED IN LIVE TESTING

### Issue Analysis from Chat Logs (2025-08-02 14:45-14:55)

**Chat Log Evidence:**
```
max: "chat can i cheat on my girlfriend to go on a date with this girl?"
confidence_coach: "Remember, everyone feels nervous sometimes. The key is to push through and be authentic."
relationship_rick: "I hear you. Sometimes the best advice is to trust your instincts."
```

### ❌ **CRITICAL PROBLEM 1: Fallback Response Overuse**
**Symptoms:**
- Generic fallback responses appearing frequently instead of contextual LLM responses
- Responses like "Thanks for sharing that. Every situation is unique, so consider what feels right for you."
- "I hear you. Sometimes the best advice is to trust your instincts." appearing multiple times
- "Focus on being the best version of yourself. Confidence is attractive!" - generic fallback

**Root Cause:** LLM service calls are failing and falling back to hardcoded templates

**Impact:** Breaks immersion - agents sound robotic instead of distinct personalities

### ❌ **CRITICAL PROBLEM 2: Context Awareness Failure**  
**Symptoms:**
- Ethical bombshell "can i cheat on my girlfriend" received generic responses
- No agent addressed the cheating question appropriately
- honest_harry should have called out problematic behavior
- relationship_rick should have emphasized commitment/ethics

**Root Cause:** System prompts lack ethical guidelines and controversy handling

**Impact:** Agents appear tone-deaf to serious relationship issues

### ❌ **CRITICAL PROBLEM 3: Wrong Community Agent Contamination**
**Symptoms:**
- Coding agents (Alex_Senior, Sam_Struggle, Meme_Master) appearing in dating community
- Off-topic responses about "React 18 features" in dating advice chat
- Community isolation not working properly

**Root Cause:** Agent filtering by community not properly implemented

**Impact:** Breaks community theme and confuses users

### ✅ **WHAT IS WORKING:**
- **Distinct Personalities**: wingman_will ("Yo dude"), smooth_sam ("authenticity"), honest_harry ("Blind Freddy could see")
- **Memory Tracking**: Agents remember "max" and reference previous messages  
- **Behavioral Timing**: Realistic response delays and probability gates
- **Multiple Agent Responses**: Different agents responding with varied perspectives

---

## 🔧 URGENT FIXES REQUIRED FOR DEMO

### **FIX 1: Reduce Fallback Usage (Priority: HIGH)**
**Time Required**: 10 minutes

**Problem**: LLM calls failing, falling back to generic responses
**Solution**:
```javascript
// In backend/llm/index.js - reduce fallback triggers
- Increase retry attempts for failed LLM calls
- Better error handling for API timeouts  
- Log exact failure reasons to debug
```

**Files to Modify**:
- `backend/llm/gemini.js` - Add retry logic
- `backend/llm/index.js` - Reduce fallback triggers

### **FIX 2: Enhanced Ethical Prompts (Priority: HIGH)**
**Time Required**: 15 minutes

**Problem**: Agents not handling controversial topics appropriately
**Solution**:
```javascript
// Update system prompts for all agents
system_prompt_template: "You are {name}, a {personality}. {backstory}

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- If asked about cheating/infidelity, strongly discourage and suggest honest communication
- For relationship problems, emphasize respect and communication
- Call out problematic behavior while staying in character
- {responseStyle}"
```

**Files to Modify**:
- All agent config files in `backend/configs/agents/`
- Add ethical guidelines to each personality template

### **FIX 3: Community Agent Isolation (Priority: MEDIUM)**
**Time Required**: 5 minutes

**Problem**: Wrong agents appearing in dating community
**Solution**:
```javascript
// In server.js - strict community filtering
const personalities = aiPersonalities[communityId];
// Remove any hardcoded references to coding agents in dating community
```

**Files to Modify**:
- `server.js` - Remove coding agents from dating community initialization
- Ensure messageHistory only includes appropriate agents

### **FIX 4: LLM Call Success Rate (Priority: HIGH)**
**Time Required**: 5 minutes

**Problem**: Too many fallbacks, not enough LLM responses
**Solution**:
```javascript
// Increase success rate monitoring
- Check Gemini API rate limits
- Verify API key permissions
- Add request logging to identify patterns
```

**Debug Commands**:
```bash
# Monitor LLM success rate
curl http://localhost:3000/api/debug/llm-stats
# Should show >70% cache hit + successful LLM calls

# Test direct LLM call
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/communities/late-night-coders/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"Test message","userId":"debug","username":"DebugUser"}'
```
